Project
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Feature Engineering

## Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering** for a predictive modeling task. The goal is to understand the dataset, identify patterns, and create meaningful features to improve the performance of a machine learning model.

## Tasks & Analysis
### **1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Data Distributions**: Analyzed skewness and distribution of key variables.
- **Feature Correlations**: Identified relationships between variables and their influence on the target.
- **Key Insights**:
  - Some numerical features were highly skewed and required transformations.
  - Certain categorical variables had low variance and were dropped.
  - Features such as tenure and pricing trends showed potential predictive power.

### **2. Feature Engineering**
- **Transformation of Date Features**: Converted dates into meaningful numerical values.
- **Price Change Analysis**: Created features analyzing price fluctuations over time.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Applied label encoding and one-hot encoding where necessary.
- **Skewness Treatment**: Applied log transformation for highly skewed numerical features.
- **Feature Selection**: Removed redundant or highly correlated features to improve model efficiency.

### **3. Model Training & Evaluation**
- Implemented a **Random Forest Classifier** for churn prediction.
- **Train-Test Split**: 75%-25% split for model training and validation.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - **Accuracy**: High but misleading due to class imbalance.
  - **Precision & Recall**: The model struggled with recall, missing many true churn cases.
  - **Feature Importance**: Tenure, pricing, and contract renewal showed high predictive influence.

## Conclusion & Next Steps
### **Key Takeaways**
- The dataset required significant preprocessing due to missing values, skewness, and categorical variables.
- Price sensitivity was a weak predictor of churn, while contract renewal and tenure were stronger indicators.
- The model needs further improvements, especially in handling class imbalance and recall.

### **Action Items**
1. **Improve Feature Engineering**: Create more predictive features related to customer behavior.
2. **Optimize Model Parameters**: Experiment with hyperparameter tuning.
3. **Balance the Dataset**: Use SMOTE or class weighting to improve recall.
4. **Try Alternative Models**: Consider boosting algorithms like XGBoost or LightGBM.
